This Project takes data from a survey and compares to other entries to match the closest responses.

## Getting Started

Go To: [Friend Finder]()

### How to Use

On the home page, click "Start Survey" to begin. The survey requires a Name and all 10 Questions to be answered. Once complete, click Submit. You will then see a modal with your closest match based on the 10 questions. If you are evenly matched with more than 1 user, you will have a "Next" button appear at the bottom of the Modal to cycle through your matches.
